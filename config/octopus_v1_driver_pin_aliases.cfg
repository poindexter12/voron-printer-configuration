# =============================================================================
# octopus_v1_driver_pin_aliases.cfg  — Physical driver socket pin mappings for Octopus V1.0
# =============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Map each of the 8 physical stepper driver sockets (DRIVER0…DRIVER7)
#   on the BigTreeTech Octopus V1.0 to easy-to-use pin aliases.
#
# NAMING CONVENTION:
#   DRIVER{n}_STEP_PIN         — STEP pulse input
#   DRIVER{n}_DIRECTION_PIN    — direction control
#   DRIVER{n}_ENABLE_PIN       — enable input (active-low for TMC drivers)
#   DRIVER{n}_CHIP_SELECT_PIN  — SPI chip-select (active-low)
#
# USAGE:
#   In your printer.cfg, at the very top add:
#     [include octopus_v1_driver_pin_aliases.cfg]
#
#   Then reference pins like:
#     step_pin: DRIVER0_STEP_PIN
#     dir_pin:  DRIVER0_DIRECTION_PIN
#     enable_pin: DRIVER0_ENABLE_PIN
#     cs_pin:   DRIVER0_CHIP_SELECT_PIN
#
# WHEN TO UPDATE:
#   • If you remap a driver to a different socket
#   • If you change boards (just adjust these aliases, your main .cfg stays clean)
