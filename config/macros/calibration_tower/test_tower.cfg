# ===== Test Configuration for Calibration Tower =====
# This file shows how to use the different modes of CONFIGURATION_TOWER

# ===== Mode 1: Test Mesh Only =====
# This will print only the initial mesh layer for adhesion testing
# Usage: CONFIGURATION_TOWER CALIBRATION_BLOCKS=0
# Expected: Prints mesh pattern, then stops

# ===== Mode 2: Single Configuration Block =====
# This will print the mesh + one 25-layer calibration block
# Usage: CONFIGURATION_TOWER CALIBRATION_BLOCKS=1
# Expected: Prints mesh + one calibration block with retraction testing

# ===== Mode 3: Full Calibration Tower =====
# This will print the complete tower with multiple blocks
# Usage: CONFIGURATION_TOWER CALIBRATION_BLOCKS=15
# Expected: Prints mesh + 15 calibration blocks with varying parameters

# ===== Example Commands =====
# Test mesh only:
# CONFIGURATION_TOWER CALIBRATION_BLOCKS=0

# Test single block:
# CONFIGURATION_TOWER CALIBRATION_BLOCKS=1

# Test full tower (default):
# CONFIGURATION_TOWER

# Custom parameters example:
# CONFIGURATION_TOWER CALIBRATION_BLOCKS=5 LAYERS_PER_TEST=20 STARTING_RETRACTION_DISTANCE=0.3
