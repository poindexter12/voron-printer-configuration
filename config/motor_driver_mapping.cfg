# =============================================================================
# motor_driver_mapping.cfg  — Voron 2.4 Axis-to-Driver Mapping (Octopus V1.0)
# =============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Map each logical Voron axis to the underlying DRIVERn pin aliases
#   defined in octopus_v1_driver_pin_aliases.cfg.
#
#   • We’re ignoring the extruder here (it's on CANbus).
#   • The Octopus has two Z sockets on DRIVER2, but to control
#     each Z motor independently we repurpose DRIVER3 for the
#     second Z motor.  Thus:
#       – Z0 uses DRIVER2 (first Z output)
#       – Z1 uses DRIVER3 (formerly “MOTOR3”)
#
# USAGE:
#   1. Include your driver aliases first:
#        [include octopus_v1_driver_pin_aliases.cfg]
#   2. Then include this mapping:
#        [include motor_driver_mapping.cfg]
#   3. Reference these in your stepper sections:
#        step_pin: X_STEP_PIN
#        dir_pin:  X_DIRECTION_PIN
#        enable_pin: X_ENABLE_PIN
#        cs_pin:   X_CHIP_SELECT_PIN
